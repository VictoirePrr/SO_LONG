# So_Long Project üê±‚Äçüíª

## About
The **So_Long** project is a simple 2D game developed as part of my 42 School curriculum. It revolves around a small cat navigating through a map, collecting strawberries before reaching the little box to hide. üì¶

## Requirements
- **Graphics Library**: MinilibX
- **OS**: macOS or Linux (with appropriate MinilibX library installed)
- **Compiling**: Using `make`

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VictoirePrr/SO_LONG.git
    cd so_long
    ```

2. **Make the project**:
    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. After compiling, the game will be ready to play with the executable `so_long`.

## How to Play

1. **Start the game**:
    In the terminal, run the game with the command:
    ```bash
    ./so_long map_file.ber
    ```
    The `map.ber` is a `.ber` file that contains the layout of your game world.

2. **Game Controls**:
    - **W**: Move up
    - **A**: Move left
    - **S**: Move down
    - **D**: Move right
    - **Arrow Keys**: You can also use the arrow keys to move the player in the respective directions (up, down, left, right).
    - **ESC**: Exit the game

3. **Objective**:
    The goal is to navigate through the maze, collect items, and reach the exit.

4. **Map Layout**:
    - **P**: Player's starting position
    - **C**: Collectible item (e.g., a coin)
    - **E**: Exit
    - **1**: Wall (impassable)
    - **0**: Free space (walkable)

## Notes
- The game ends once the player reaches the exit (the little box) (`E`) after collecting all required items (the collectibles represented by `C`).
- The player cannot pass through walls (`1`).
- The map must be carefully designed, ensuring that there is a valid path to the exit.
